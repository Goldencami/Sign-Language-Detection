# Sign-Language-Detection
A fun project I decided to do after being so busy. The motivation behind this is a custom sign language created in honor of my late grandpa who's family couldn't afford learning sign language. They were therefor faced with the only option of inventing a unique sign language for him.

## Installation
These projects were created and tested on a virtual environment using Anaconda. Open Anaconda Prompt and write the following lines.

### Create a new anaconda environment
```bash
conda create --name Sign_Language_env python=3.11
```

### Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate Sign_Language_env
```
### Install Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install opencv-python scikit-learn mediapipe
```

## Deactivate an active environment
```bash
conda deactivate
```
